!CHAPTER Advanced functions

This chapter is about the more advanced features of Foxx.
It requires that you have understood all chapters before as these are getting rather close to the core of Foxx.

The first advanced feature of Foxx is to write Foxx exports.
They are used to define an internal API that can be used by other Foxxes but is not exposed publicly.
One use case for Foxx exports is a user management:
You want to have it centralized and accessible by other Foxxes as a shared user-base.
Though each Foxx should offer its own customized login and register functionality on top of that and you only want this one exposed.

So the user management can be implemented using [Exports](../Advanced/Exports.md).

But you would also like to make use of an application with exports in other Foxxes.
The counterpart of exports is [Dependency Injection](../Advanced/Injection.md) described thereafter.
