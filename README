ArangoDB

ArangoDB is a multi-model, open-source database with flexible data models for
documents, graphs, and key-values. Build high performance applications using a
convenient SQL-like query language or JavaScript extensions. Use ACID
transactions if you require them. Scale horizontally and vertically with a few
mouse clicks.
ArangoDB is Polyglot Persistence done right. The supported data models can be
mixed in queries and allow ArangoDB to be the aggregation point for the data
request you have in mind.
To get started, try one of our 10 Minutes Tutorials in your favourite
programming language or try one of our ArangoDB_Cookbook_recipes.
For the impatient: download and install ArangoDB. Start the server arangod and
point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8529/.

Key Features in ArangoDB

Multi-Model Documents, graphs and key-value pairs — model your data as you
see fit for your application.
Joins Conveniently join what belongs together for flexible ad-hoc querying,
less data redundancy.
Transactions Easy application development keeping your data consistent and
safe. No hassle in your client.
Here is an AQL query that makes use of all those features:  AQL Query Example
Joins and Transactions are key features for flexible, secure data designs,
widely used in RDBMSs that you won’t want to miss in NoSQL products. You
decide how and when to use Joins and strong consistency guarantees, keeping all
the power for scaling and performance as choice.
Furthermore, ArangoDB offers a microservice framework called Foxx to build your
own Rest API with a few lines of code.

Next step, bundle your Foxx application as a docker_container and get it
running in the cloud.

Key features include:


* Schema-free schemata let you combine the space efficiency of MySQL with the
  performance power of NoSQL
* Use a data-centric microservices approach with ArangoDB Foxx and fuse your
  application-logic and database together for maximal throughput
* JavaScript for all: no language zoo, you can use one language from your
  browser to your back-end
* ArangoDB is multi-threaded - exploit the power of all your cores
* Flexible data modelling: model your data as combination of key-value pairs,
  documents or graphs - perfect for social relations
* Free index choice: use the correct index for your problem, be it a skip list
  or a fulltext search
* Configurable durability: let the application decide if it needs more
  durability or more performance
* No-nonsense storage: ArangoDB uses all of the power of modern storage
  hardware, like SSD and large caches
* Powerful query language (AQL) to retrieve and modify data
* Transactions: run queries on multiple documents or collections with optional
  transactional consistency and isolation
* Replication and Sharding: set up the database in a master-slave configuration
  or spread bigger datasets across multiple servers
* It is open source (Apache Licence 2.0)

Latest Release - ArangoDB 2.5

The full changelog could be found in the documentation.
Sparse Indizes: In ArangoDB 2.5, hash and skiplist indexes can optionally be
made sparse. Here is a performance_comparison that shows how you can benefit
from great savings in memory and index creation CPU time declaring indexes as
sparse.
We’ve added some small but useful AQL language improvements plus several AQL
optimizer improvements.
Object attribute names in ArangoDB 2.5 can be specified using static string
literals, bind parameters, and dynamic expressions.
Function RANDOM_TOKEN(length): produces a pseudo-random string of the specified
length. Such strings can be used for id or token generation.
One example implementation is the API-Key_management that restricts access to
certain routes of an API. You can use this custom Foxx library to start
charging your valuable data right away.
Streamlined development process: ArangoDB 2.5 improves the development process
of data-centric microservices with the Foxx framework.
Installing an app is now as easy as it should be: * install: get your Foxx app
up and running * uninstall: shut it down and erase it from disk
Developers can enable the new development mode for a single app. This
deactivates caching and provides fine-graded debugging information.
